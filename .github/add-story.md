🌟 **My Experience:**  
I started my open-source journey during Hacktoberfest 2023. At first, I was nervous about contributing because I thought I needed to be an expert in coding. But then I discovered projects that welcomed **non-code contributions** like improving documentation, writing tutorials, and designing simple graphics.  

## 📖 Story Details

- **First Contribution (Month/Year):** [e.g., October 2023]
- **Tech/Tools Used:** [e.g., Python, Documentation, Git, Markdown]
- **Short Summary (3-5 lines):** [Briefly summarize your story, what you contributed, and your key takeaway.]
