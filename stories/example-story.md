## 🌟 My Experience

I started my open-source journey during **Hacktoberfest 2023**. At first, I was nervous about contributing because I thought I needed to be an expert in coding. But then I discovered projects that welcomed **non-code contributions** like improving documentation, writing tutorials, and designing simple graphics.

My first PR was fixing a small **typo in documentation**—and it got merged! That moment gave me the confidence to contribute more. Since then, I’ve shared tutorials, written blogs, and even translated README files into my native language. The experience taught me that open source is truly about community and communication.

## 📌 Advice for Beginners

Don’t wait to be "perfect" at coding. Start small—fix a typo, write a blog, or share your story here.
