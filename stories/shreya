# My Open Source Journey ✨

**👤 Name:** Shreya   
**📅 First Contribution:** October 2025  
**🔧 Tools/Tech Used:** Git, GitHub, Markdown  
**🌟 My Experience:**  
I started my open source journey with Hacktoberfest 2025. At first, I was nervous because contributing to public repositories felt complicated. But once I learned the basics of forking, branching, and making pull requests, it became much clearer. My first contribution was writing my open-source learning story for this project, which gave me confidence to contribute more in the future. I realized that open source is not just about code—it’s about collaboration, documentation, and sharing experiences.  

**📌 Advice for Beginners:**  
Start small. Even adding documentation or sharing your story counts. The important thing is to learn the workflow and take the first step—you’ll grow from there!
