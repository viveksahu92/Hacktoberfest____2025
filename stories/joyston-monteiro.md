**🔧 Tools/Tech Used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, GitHub,React js

**🌟 My Experience:**  
My open-source journey started in August 2025,when I decided to step out of my comfort zone and contribute to real-world projects.At first,it was a bit intimidating but once I understood the workflow of forking,branching and creating pull requests,everything started to make sense.I learned how to collaborate with developers,follow contribution guidelines and write cleaner, more readable code.Every contribution,no matter how small gave me a sense of purpose and motivation to keep improving.Open source has not only enhanced my technical skills but also helped me become a more confident and connected developer.  

**📌 Advice for Beginners:**  
Don’t wait for the “perfect” project to start.Pick something simple,read the documentation carefully and make your first PR you’ll learn more by doing than by waiting.Every line of code you contribute helps you grow.
