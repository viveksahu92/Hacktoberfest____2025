# My Learning Adventure 🚀

👤 **Name:** [Ankit Kumar Yadav]  
📅 **First Contribution:** August 2025  
🔧 **Tools/Tech Used:** VS Code, Git, Markdown, Github

🌟 **My Experience:**  
I began my learning journey with curiosity and a bit of uncertainty. Exploring new tools and reading stories from others inspired me to try things myself. My first project was chromo dino-game clone and sharing them with friends, which helped me build confidence.

As I continued, I started contributing by good first issue and experimented with coding, replaced links, wrote simple scripts for cli, fixed typo and contributed to semi-big projects. Each small achievement motivated me to keep going and learn more.

📌 **Advice for Beginners:**  
Start with what excites you. Don’t be afraid to ask questions or make mistakes. Every step forward is progress, and sharing your journey can inspire others too! 🌱
