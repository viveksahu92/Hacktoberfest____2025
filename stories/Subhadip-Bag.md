# My Open Source Journey ✨

👤 **Name:** Subhadip Bag  
📅 **First Contribution:** October 2025  
🔧 **Tools/Tech Used:** Python, GitHub, Markdown, Java

🌟 My Experience:
I began my open-source journey form this Hacktoberfest 2025. Initially, I hesitated to contribute because I thought I had to be an expert coder. But then I discovered that many open-source projects welcome non-code contributions—like improving documentation, creating tutorials, and even designing simple graphics.

My first pull request was a solution to a LeetCode problem, and when it got merged. That moment boosted my confidence and motivated me to contribute more. Since then, I’ve written tutorials, published blog posts, and even translated README files into my native language.

📌 Advice for Beginners:
Don’t wait until you feel "perfect" at coding. Start small—whether it's fixing a typo, writing a blog post, or sharing your journey. Every contribution counts in open source, no matter how big or small! 🚀
