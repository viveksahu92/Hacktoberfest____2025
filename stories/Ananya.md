# My Open Source Journey ✨

👤 **Name:** Ananya Arya  
📅 **First Contribution:** October 2025  
🔧 **Tools/Tech Used:** C++, GitHub, Markdown  

🌟 **My Experience:**  
I am starting my open-source journey during Hacktoberfest 2025. At first, I was nervous about contributing because I thought I needed to be an expert in coding. But then I discovered projects that welcomed **non-code contributions** like improving documentation, writing tutorials, and designing simple graphics.  

My first PR was adding codes for dsa – and it got merged! That moment gave me the confidence to contribute more. 

📌 **Advice for Beginners:**  
Don’t wait to be “perfect” at coding. Start small – fix a typo, write a blog, or share your story here. Every contribution matters in open source! 🚀
