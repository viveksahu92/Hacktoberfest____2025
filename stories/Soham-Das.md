## 🌟 My Experience

I started my open-source journey during **Hacktoberfest 2023**. At first, I felt nervous because I thought I needed to be an expert in coding to contribute. But I soon realized that even small contributions—like fixing bugs, improving documentation, or adding beginner-friendly features—are highly appreciated and valuable.

My first PR was on a **React project** where I fixed a small UI bug, and it got merged quickly! That positive experience gave me the confidence to contribute more. Since then, I’ve contributed to multiple projects, explored different tech stacks, and learned how collaboration truly works in open-source development.

## 📌 Advice for Beginners

Don’t wait to be perfect. Start small—fix a typo, improve documentation, or contribute a simple feature. Every contribution helps you learn and grow!
