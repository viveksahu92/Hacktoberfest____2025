#My Open Source Journey ✨

👤 **Name:** Anushka Gupta
📅 **First Contribution:** Jan 2025 
🔧 **Tools/Tech Used:** Java, GitHub, Markdown  

🌟 **My Experience:**  
I started my open-source journey during Hacktoberfest 2025. At first, I was nervous about contributing because I thought I needed to be an expert in coding. But i started.

My first PR was fixing a small typo in documentation – and it got merged! That moment gave me the confidence to contribute more. Since then, I’ve shared tutorials, written blogs, and even translated README files into my native language.  

📌 **Advice for Beginners:**  
Don’t wait to be “perfect” at coding. Start small – fix a typo, write a blog, or share your story here. Every contribution matters in open source! 🚀
