# My Open Source Journey ✨

**👤 Name:** Akanksha Patnaik

**📅 First Contribution:** October 2025

**🔧 Tools/Tech Used:** Python

**🌟 My Experience:**
I began my open source journey by participating in Hacktoberfest 2025.
At first, I started by making comments and slowly progressed to making real contributions.
It was challenging, and I thought of quitting, but I reminded myself that if I stop trying, I’ll never know what’s on the other side of participating and contributing.
Looking back, even though it’s been only a few days, I’ve learned how to create issues, make pull requests, leave meaningful comments, and much more.

**📌 Advice for Beginners:**
All you have to do is **never give up, no matter what.**
