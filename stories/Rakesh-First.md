🌟 **My Experience:**

I began my open-source journey during **Hacktoberfest 2024**. At first, I was nervous—I thought contributing required being an expert coder. But I quickly discovered that open source values *all kinds of contributions*: fixing bugs, enhancing documentation, or adding beginner-friendly features.

My very first PR was a small fix on a React project—a simple UI bug. When it got merged, it gave me a huge confidence boost and encouraged me to dive deeper. Since then, I’ve contributed to multiple repositories, explored new tech stacks, and truly experienced the power of collaboration in open-source development.

📌 **Advice for Beginners:**

💡 Don’t wait until you feel "ready" or "perfect." Start small—fix a typo, improve documentation, or tackle a simple feature. Every contribution matters, and each step helps you learn, grow, and become part of the open-source community. 🚀
