# My Open Source Journey ✨

👤 Name: Ishan Peshkar  
📅 First Contribution: September 2025  
🔧 Tools/Tech Used: C++, Python, Git, GitHub, Markdown  
🌟 My Experience:  
My open source journey began when I contributed my first PR to the **dsa-codes** repository, where I solved the classic *Two Sum* problem in C++. That was my very first merged PR, and it gave me a lot of confidence.  

Now, I’m working on my second contribution — sharing my story in the **Learning Stories** repo. Through these contributions, I’ve learned how to fork repositories, clone them locally, make changes, and raise pull requests. I also realized that contributions don’t always have to be code — documenting experiences and helping others is equally valuable.

I started exploring open source out of curiosity during Hacktoberfest. At first, I was unsure about where to begin, but soon realized that contributions don’t always have to be code. Writing stories, improving docs, and sharing experiences are just as valuable.  
Through this contribution, I learned how to fork a repo, clone it locally, make changes, and create a pull request. It gave me a lot more confidence to participate in open source projects. I’m excited to keep learning and contributing more in the future.  


Each step has made me more confident and motivated to continue exploring and contributing to open source. 🚀  

📌 Advice for Beginners:  
Start with something simple — even a small code contribution or writing your story can be meaningful. Every contribution matters, and it’s the best way to learn and grow. 🌱
